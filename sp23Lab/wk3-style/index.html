            What else does one expect on html tags? Internet's user experience are wrecked when CSS aren't rendered
            <br>Have you ever see Twitter with it logo cover 80% of the page and push timeline to the corner that I can't reach?
            <br>Or 200 lines of collapsed link that were meat to hide in the header?
            <br>or thousands of tags that only make sense to google?
            <br><sub>To be honest, I kinda miss the Internet a decade ago.</sub>
