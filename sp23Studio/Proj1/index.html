                Theme: printed material with animation that let the punctuation flow through
                sans, hand written, 2 serif of different style

                first: work sans for basic legbility 
                and rest for extra exploration on different typeface (optional)

                responsive: allow +- 20% on computer browser

                animation: reflect on the content (although grabbing the attention away, but reflect on the mood i feel when I read the article)

                struggle: js and css and grid.

            <div class="seg1" id="seg1">
                    <div class="seg1-1">
                        <br><br>
                        <div>                   
                            Let us begin with the punctuations that are not.  <br>
                            Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark.<br>
                            The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle <br>
                            or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. <br>
                            It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question <br>
                            but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. <br>
                            Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.
                        </div><br>
                        <div>
                            Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing <br>
                            and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, <br>
                            just an unnecessary name of something. <br>
                            A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question <br>
                            and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there <br>
                            when the question is already there in the writing. <br>
                        </div><br>
                        <div>
                            Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark,  <br>
                            I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. <br>
                        </div>

            <div class="seg2" id="seg2">
                
                
                <div class="seg2-2">
            
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p>
                    Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, <br>
                    they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing <br>
                    or the printing and anyway what is the use, <br>
                    if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. <br>
                    </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                    The same thing is true of a quotation. <br>
                    When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks <br>
                    and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. <br>
                    Perhaps some day they will see it some other way <br>
                    but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way. <br>
                    </p>
                        <br> <br>
                    <p>
                        So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation <br> 
                        uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, <br>
                        and so we do not have to go any farther into that. <br>
                        There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. <br>
                        They might if one felt that way about them. <br>
                    </p>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>
                    One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about <br>
                    and that is the apostrophe for possession. <br>
                    Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that <br>
                    for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation <br>
                    that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. <br>
                    </p>
                        <br><br>
                    <div>
                            One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time <br>
                            I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. <br>
                            I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental <br>
                            but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. <br>
                            At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone <br>
                            if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. <br>
                            I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. <br>
                    </div>

                    So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters. <br>
                    I have had a long and complicated life with all these. <br>

                            When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on 
                            but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity 
                            that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, 
                            what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it 
                            to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. 
                            What had colons and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it.

                        What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, <br>
                        physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime <br>
                        and  if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist. <br>
                        Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did. <br>

                        Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, <br>
                        it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, <br>
                        I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped using them.<br>
                        Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, <br>
                        that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, <br>

                        By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. <br>

                        that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them <br>
                        but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing <br>
                        and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist <br>
                        in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. <br>

                        There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas <br>
                        and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods <br>
                        and then using them can make you feel adventurous <br>
                        I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, <br>
                        I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma <br>
                        and commas are servile they have no life of their own <br>
                        they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. <br>

                        Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character <br>
                        the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has <br>
                        and therefore and definitely I have never used them. <br>
                        But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them <br>
                        something of the character of the period <br>
                        and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. <br>
                        I think however lively they are or disguised they are <br>
                        they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. <br>
                        They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. <br>
                        They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature. <br>
                        And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them. <br>

                        I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions <br>
                        and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing. <br>

                        <br><br>
                        When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, <br>
                        at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool <br>
                        so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. <br>
                        And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing <br>
                        that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. <br>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma,<br>
                        well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath <br>
                        but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. <br>
                        It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, <br>
                        but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. <br>
                        Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. <br>
                        And so I almost never used a comma. <br>

                        The longer, the more complicated the sentence <br>
                        the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another,<br>
                        the more the very more I had of them the more <br>
                        I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, <br>
                        and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.<br>
